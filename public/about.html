<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Deanne Gonsalves, a passionate and curious B.Tech Engineering student currently in my second year. 
  Alongside my academic journey, I've developed a strong interest in web development and am actively working toward becoming a skilled full-stack web developer. What started as a fascination with how websites function has grown into a deep commitment to learning both frontend and backend technologies. 
  I'm currently gaining hands-on experience with tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and diving into frameworks such as React for the frontend, while also exploring Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend.
</p>

<p>I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and believe that the best way to learn is by building. 
  Whether Iâ€™m designing responsive user interfaces or developing robust server-side logic, I always strive to 
  create meaningful, user-centric solutions. I'm also learning about best practices in coding, version control 
  with Git, and working on small projects to strengthen my skills. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer capable of contributing to impactful tech projects. I'm excited about the journey ahead and always
   open to opportunities for internships, collaborations, and learning from experienced developers in the field.</p>
